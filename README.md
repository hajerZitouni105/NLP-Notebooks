# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Notebooks

## Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques. The project comprises notebooks that guide learners through essential NLP methodologies: introduce fundamental concepts, cover text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization and normalization, feature extraction methods such as Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, which transform text data into numerical representations, also delve into sentiment analysis, showcasing how to classify text based on sentiment using machine learning models, and named entity recognition (NER), where key entities in text are identified and classified.  Together, these notebooks provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding and applying NLP techniques.
