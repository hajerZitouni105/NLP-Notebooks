# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Notebooks

## Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques. The project comprises five notebooks that guide learners through essential NLP methodologies. The first notebook introduces fundamental concepts and covers text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization and normalization. The second notebook focuses on feature extraction methods such as Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, which transform text data into numerical representations. The third and fourth notebooks delve into sentiment analysis, showcasing how to classify text based on sentiment using machine learning models, and named entity recognition (NER), where key entities in text are identified and classified. Finally, the fifth notebook explores topic modeling using algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover hidden themes in text corpora. Together, these notebooks provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding and applying NLP techniques.
